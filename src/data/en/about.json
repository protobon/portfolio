        "I did the Software Engineering Foundations program at Holberton School Uruguay in 2021, and graduated in 2022, around the time ChatGPT was released to the public. Since then, I am working hard and keep studying the best and latest technologies to understand how they help us in real life, and be part of the people who make it possible.",
        "Now, I am a full-stack developer with a main focus on server infrastructure, high availability, scalability, and quick recovery from disaster.",
        "I can really say that I am proud of the progress I’ve made so far, but it’s not enough. With the rise in Artificial Intelligence technologies, it now feels like service infrastructure is just something you need to know by hand, so you can focus on the opportunities AI has to offer, while also adapting into this new era of technology."
